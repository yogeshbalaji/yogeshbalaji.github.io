              I was the only student from India selected for summer internship at Qualcomm Research, San Diego. Here, I worked under my manager Aleksandar Damnjanovic guided by my mentor Qingsi Wang. LTE usage in unlicensed spectrum provides immense benefits as spectrum comes free of cost. But, when used this way, it would interfere with WiFi, Blurtooth and other technologies that operate in this regime. To handle this issue, we set out to develop MAC layer algorithms that would enable fair coexistence between LTE-U and WiFi (predominant user of unlicensed spectrum). We carried out intense system simulations and worked out theoretical bounds to quantify the performance of our developed algorithms.   </p>

               In Dhvani, I was working on estimating crack dimension in a solid object using phosphorescent images of cracks. Using simple image processing techniques, the crack was extracted and these samples were used to fit a curve. The fitted curve was then mapped to the 3D CAD model of the object using ray tracing. From this, crack dimension in real world coordinates were obtained

               In CEWiT, for many of the simuations, 2D channel model was used where no variation in z-dimension was assumed. By then, 3GPP had released specifications for 3D channel model. My work involved implementing 3GPP SCM 3D channel model and estimating small and large scale parameters. I compared this system against the channel 2D model that was in use to study the gains bought by the 3D model.

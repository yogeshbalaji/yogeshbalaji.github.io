               We developed a primitive robotic arm that plays air hockey with the opponent. The basic framework involved an overhead camera whose video feed was used to track the puck. The puck motion was used to estimate the position where the arm had to move so as to make the best hit. The arm was built using servo motors fitted with a pneumatic piston to shoot. We built the entire system (both hardware and software) at a cost less than 100$. Have a look at the demo video. <br>

               Augmented reality is a live direct or an indirect view of real world where some objects are supplemented by computer software. In this project, we detect a known pattern (which can also be a known image) from live video stream and replace it with another video. The demo video aside shows one such experiment where a pattern in newspaper was replaced, which created the effect of newspapers in the Harry Potter series. <br>

               I was a part of team "Sahas" - team from IIT-Madras pariticipating in Federation of International Robot-soccer Assosiation (FIRA) contest. As a part of Computer Vision module, I built a system that performs automatic dynamic calibration of colours in varying lighting conditions. I also helped build some path planning strategies for the players in the game. <br>

             <font size="3"><b>Virtual Lab</b></font> <br> 
               This project was motivated by the lack of online laboratory courses. There are several online platforms like coursera, MIT OCW and NPTEL which targets theory courses. But, there are no laboratory courses available for online learning. So, this project involved making a GUI for virtually building circuits, solving them and examining the outputs. We built the circuit for components exhibting linear behaviour. We also extended it to IC's where datasheets were scanned to encode element behaviours. <br>

               In the vision literature, visual saliency depicts the distinctive percentual quality that makes some items stand out and grab our attention. Detection of salient objects is very useful in vision tasks like segmentation and object detection. The goal of this project was to predict the saliency map and to segment out foreground regions from background. We implemented a discriminative bottom-up feature integration approach to learn the salient regions. Foreground regions were extracted by feeding the predicted salience map to Grab Cut algorithm. This step preserved good edges during foreground extraction.  <br>

                  <br>
               In this project, we developed a spell check application that detects and corrects mistakes in the given text. First part of the project involved Context free spell check, where words that are not found in the dictionary were detected and relevant suggestions were made. We implemented this as a Noisy channel model (noise modelled as edit distance) with speed boosting using pruned tries. In the second part, we implemented Context Sensitive spell check, where the words out of context were detected and suggestions made. This was implemented using a Bayesian classifier with context words and collocations as features.

               I am an avid participant of Hackathons and tech competitions. Some of these are mentioned below:<br>
               
               <b>Microsoft Hackathon:</b> I was a part of team of 4 which developed Smart Home applications using Kinect. We built a system that controls a device (say television, tibelight, etc.) based on gestures made. We mapped unique gestures to each of the switchboard connections which enabled us to control any device using the corresponding gestures. <br>
               
               <b>Shaastra Circuit Design Challenge (SCDC):</b> In SCDC, our team solved two problems - voice controlled switch and navigation system for blind. In voice controlled switch, we developed an app that performes speech recognition and controls a switchboard based on the speech received. In the navigation system for blind, we made a walking stick fitted with ultrasonic sensors that detect any obstacle and guides the person accordingly.
